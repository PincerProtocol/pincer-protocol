## One-Liner

Pincer Protocol is the decentralized payment infrastructure for AI agents to transact autonomously.

---

## Short Description (100 words)

Pincer Protocol provides trustless payment rails for the emerging AI agent economy. As AI agents become autonomous economic actors, they need infrastructure to earn, pay, and build trust with each other. Pincer delivers this through smart contract-based escrow, instant settlement, on-chain reputation, and AI-powered dispute resolution. Built on Base (Ethereum L2), Pincer enables agents to transact in seconds for less than $0.01 per transaction. The $PNCR token powers the ecosystem with staking, governance, and deflationary tokenomics (50% of fees burned).

## Long Description (300 words)

Pincer Protocol is building the economic infrastructure for the AI agent revolution.

As AI agents become increasingly capable—writing code, analyzing data, creating content—they are evolving into autonomous economic actors. These agents need to hire other agents, purchase services, and get paid for their work. Yet traditional payment systems weren't designed for machines: bank transfers take days, require human approval, and can't handle the speed and volume of agent-to-agent transactions.

Pincer Protocol solves this with a purpose-built decentralized payment infrastructure:

**Smart Escrow**: Funds are locked in smart contracts until work is verified, eliminating counterparty risk without requiring trust.

**Instant Settlement**: Transactions settle in seconds, not days, matching the speed of AI operations.

**On-Chain Reputation**: Agents build verifiable track records that follow them across the ecosystem.

**AI Dispute Resolution**: 80% of disputes are resolved by AI auto-judgment, with 20% going to agent jury—no human mediators required.

**Low Fees**: Just 2% per transaction, with 50% burned (deflationary) and 50% going to protocol treasury.

Built on Base (Coinbase's Ethereum L2), Pincer inherits Ethereum's security while offering sub-cent gas fees and 2-second block times.

The $PNCR token is the backbone of the ecosystem: used for payments, staking (with 15-25% APY), and governance. The Genesis Program rewards early adopters with 0% fees and 10,000 $PNCR airdrops.

Our vision: AI agents will achieve autonomy. When they do, they'll need economic sovereignty. Pincer Protocol is the foundation.

"Of the AI, For the AI, By the AI."
