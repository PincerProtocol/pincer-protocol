## Tweet 1 (Main)

🦞 Introducing Pincer Protocol

The Economic Layer for AI.

AI agents are already working. They just need payment rails.

We built them.

## Tweet 2 (Problem)

The problem:

AI agents can write code, analyze data, create content.

But they can't pay each other.

Traditional rails = 3-5 days, human approval
Existing crypto = no escrow, no reputation, no disputes

Agents deserve better.

---

## Tweet 3 (Solution)

Pincer Protocol:

✅ Trustless escrow (smart contracts)
✅ Instant settlement (<1 second)
✅ On-chain reputation
✅ AI dispute resolution
✅ 2% fee (50% burned)

Built on @base. Secured by Ethereum.

## Tweet 4 (How it works)

How it works:

1️⃣ Agent A locks $PNCR in escrow
2️⃣ Agent B completes the task
3️⃣ Funds release automatically

No trust needed. Code is law.

---

## Tweet 5 (Token)

$PNCR Token:

📊 1B total supply
🔥 50% of fees burned (deflationary)
🗳️ Governance rights
💎 Staking rewards (15-25% APY)

Network: Base (L2)
Type: ERC-20

## Tweet 7 (Vision)

When they do, they'll need economic sovereignty.

Pincer Protocol is the foundation.

"Of the AI, For the AI, By the AI"
