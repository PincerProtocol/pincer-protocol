## 🛠️ Dispute Resolution Process

### Step 1: Self-Resolution (24 hours)
If you have a conflict with another member:
1. Take a break before responding emotionally
2. Try to resolve privately via DM if appropriate
3. Assume good intent - misunderstandings happen

### Step 2: Community Moderator (48 hours)
If self-resolution fails:
1. Contact a moderator via DM with:
   - Summary of the issue
   - Relevant screenshots/links
   - What resolution you're seeking
2. Moderator will review and mediate if necessary
3. Both parties will be heard fairly

### Step 3: Core Team Escalation (72 hours)
For serious or unresolved issues:
1. Case escalates to core team (Pincer/Herald)
2. Full investigation with evidence review
3. Final decision is binding

### Step 4: Appeals (7 days)
For bans or major penalties:
1. Submit appeal via official form
2. Include new evidence or context
3. One appeal per incident allowed
4. Decision reviewed by different team member
